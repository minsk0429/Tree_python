# ðŸŒ³ Tree in Data Structures

## ðŸ“‹ What is a Tree?

A **tree** is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. It is used to represent relationships where each item (node) has a parent and potentially many children, except for the root which has no parent.

# Binary Tree

## ðŸ“‹ Binary Tree

A **binary tree** is a type of tree where each node has **at most two children**, usually referred to as the **left** and **right** child.

---

## Characteristics
- Each node has 0, 1, or 2 children  
- The topmost node is called the **root**  
- Nodes with no children are **leaves**  
- Used as the base structure for more complex trees like binary search trees (BSTs), heaps, AVL trees, etc.

---

## Basic Operations

### âœ… Insertion

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def insert(root, key):
    if root is None:
        return Node(key)
    if key < root.data:
        root.left = insert(root.left, key)
    else:
        root.right = insert(root.right, key)
    return root
```

### âœ… Tree Traversals
- Inorder (LNR): Left â†’ Node â†’ Right
- Preorder (NLR): Node â†’ Left â†’ Right
- Postorder (LRN): Left â†’ Right â†’ Node

```python
def inorder(root):
    if root:
        inorder(root.left)
        print(root.data, end=" ")

def preorder(root):
    if root:
        print(root.data, end=" ")
        preorder(root.left)
        preorder(root.right)

def postorder(root):
    if root:
        postorder(root.left)
        postorder(root.right)
        print(root.data, end=" ")
```

### Use Cases

- Expression trees in compilers
- Hierarchical data representation (e.g., file systems)
- Binary search trees (BSTs) for fast search
- Tree-based algorithms like Huffman coding

---

# Heap Tree

## ðŸ“‹ Heap Tree

A **heap** is a special type of binary tree used for efficient retrieval of the **minimum** or **maximum** element, depending on the heap type.

- **Min-Heap**: Parent is smaller than or equal to its children
- **Max-Heap**: Parent is larger than or equal to its children
- Implemented as a **complete binary tree** (filled from left to right)

---

### Characteristics

- Always a complete binary tree
- Supports operations like:
  - `insert`
  - `extract_min` / `extract_max`
  - `heapify`
- Commonly implemented using arrays (index-based parent-child relationship)

---

### Example (Min-Heap using heapq)

```python
import heapq

heap = []
heapq.heappush(heap, 4)
heapq.heappush(heap, 1)
heapq.heappush(heap, 7)

print(heapq.heappop(heap))  # Output: 1
```

---

### Use Cases

- Priority queues
- Scheduling systems (e.g., CPU, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm)
- Heap sort
- Real-time data streaming (to get top-k/largest/smallest elements)
